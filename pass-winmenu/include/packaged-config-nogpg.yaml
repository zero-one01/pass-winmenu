# Settings for git-based password stores
git:
    # Pass-winmenu will automatically commit new and changed passwords if it
    # detects that your password store is a git repository, as well as providing
    # options for pushing to/pulling from the remote repository.
    # You can disable this feature by setting the following option to false:
    use-git: true
    # Either 'builtin' or 'native-git'. 'builtin', the default option, will use
    # the Git library to sync your password repository. This library, however,
    # has several limitations. For instance, SSH remotes are not supported.
    # By setting this value to 'native-git', pass-winmenu will use your native
    # Git installation instead.
    sync-mode: builtin
    # Path to the Git executable that should be used. Only used when sync-mode
    # is set to 'native-git'.
    git-path: git
    # Path to the ssh client executable that should be used. Only used when
    # sync-mode is set to 'native-git'. This is useful if you have a passphrase
    # on your key and want to use plink.exe/pageant.exe to supply the key.
    # Example: 'C:\Program Files\PuTTY\plink.exe'
    ssh-path: null

# GPG-related settings
gpg:
    # Path to your gpg.exe. If set to its default of null, pass-winmenu
    # will try to look for the file in its default location.
    # If you have added GPG to your PATH, you can also set this to 'gpg'.
    gpg-path: 'gpg'
    # If the GNUPGHOME environment variable is set, GPG will use that path to
    # store its keys and settings. Otherwise, GPG will choose its own location.
    # If you are unable to alter the GNUPGHOME environment variable (or if you
    # have a separate GPG homedir that isn't related to the one used for your
    # password files), you can have pass-winmenu pass along a custom value
    # to GPG. For example, like so:
    #   gnupghome-override: '%userprofile%\.gnupg'
    # This normally shouldn't be necessary.
    # The GNUPGHOME environment variable is not overridden when the value is null.
    gnupghome-override: null
    # On multi-monitor screens, pinentry often fails to make itself the foreground
    # window when it asks for your password. When enabled, this option will allow
